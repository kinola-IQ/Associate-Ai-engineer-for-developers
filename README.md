# Associate-AI-Engineer-for-Developers

Concise README for the repository `kinola-IQ/Associate-Ai-engineer-for-developers`. Contains direct instructions, repository structure, setup, usage, and contribution rules. Repository metadata: public GitHub repo, primary language Jupyter Notebook, minimal commit history and folders `Project` and `exercises`. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Overview

Repository purpose: training and hands-on exercises aimed at developers preparing for an "Associate AI Engineer" skillset. Material is delivered as Jupyter notebooks designed for study, replication, and incremental extension. The repository currently contains notebooks and two top-level folders: `Project` and `exercises`. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Repository structure

```
/
├─ Project/           # Longer-form project(s) and capstone notebooks
├─ exercises/         # Short, focused exercise notebooks
├─ .gitignore
└─ (no README or license file present in repo root originally)
```

All files are Jupyter notebooks by repository language breakdown. ([GitHub][1])

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+ (recommended).
* Git.
* Virtual environment tooling (venv, pipenv, or conda).
* JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
* Typical Python packages used in notebooks: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `ipython`, `notebook`, `jupyterlab`. Install only what each notebook requires.

---

## Quick setup (recommended)

Run these commands in the repository root.

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/kinola-IQ/Associate-Ai-engineer-for-developers.git
cd Associate-Ai-engineer-for-developers

# create venv (POSIX)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# or on Windows PowerShell
# python -m venv .venv
# .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# upgrade pip and install core tools
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab notebook ipykernel
# install common data science packages (adjust per-notebook)
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

If a `requirements.txt` is added later:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to run

1. Activate virtual environment.
2. Start JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

3. Open notebooks from `Project/` or `exercises/`. Execute cells sequentially. Save checkpoints regularly.

Optional: Convert a notebook to script for repeatable runs:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script path/to/notebook.ipynb
python path/to/notebook.py
```

---

## Recommended workflow for contributors

* Create a topic branch per feature or exercise: `git checkout -b feat/<short-desc>`.
* Limit notebook diffs:

  * Clear outputs before committing (`jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace notebook.ipynb`), or use `nbstripout`.
  * Keep data files out of repo; use dataset download scripts or `.gitignore`.
* Add a short test or reproducibility note in each notebook header describing expected inputs, outputs, and runtime.
* Commit messages: concise, imperative, reference issue if relevant.

---

## Tests and reproducibility

* Prefer small, deterministic datasets and seeded randomness (`random.seed`, `np.random.seed`) inside notebooks to ensure reproducibility.
* Where possible, provide a `data/README.md` or download script that fetches required datasets into `data/` and adds them to `.gitignore`.

---

## Suggested additions (to be committed)

* `README.md` (this file).
* `requirements.txt` or environment YAML (`environment.yml`) listing explicit package versions.
* `LICENSE` (choose MIT/Apache-2.0 or appropriate license).
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` with branching and PR rules.
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` if public collaboration is desired.
* `tests/` or small notebooks demonstrating automated checks for core exercise outputs.

---

## Contributing guidelines (minimal)

* Open pull requests to `main`.
* Keep notebook outputs out of commits or keep them minimal.
* Provide a short PR description with reproduction steps and targeted notebooks.
* Sign-off: add a one-line changelog entry in `CHANGES.md` for transparency.
